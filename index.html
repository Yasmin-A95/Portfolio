                <p>
                    I'm a Junior Software Developer keen to hit the ground running and kick-off my career with a bang! I
                    thrive
                    in the intersections of technology, creativity, and community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love participating in community
                    events either by speaking at them, helping organise them, or just enjoying the talks and free pizza.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not writing code or hanging out with fellow nerds I'm usually tinkering with something
                    artsy
                    like teaching myself how to sew, play guitar, or ceramics.
                </p>

                            might
                            be a fun experiment to try to recreate them using CSS.

                            My final project. and the hardest thing I've ever done. I took the advice of my
                            instructor
                            at
                            G.A
                            and took on a passion project with a huge scope knowing it will never be quite finished.

                            Shadows
                            is a point and click adventure game based on a short story a friend of mine wrote. It's
                            made
                            using bubble images mapped onto the inside of three.js spheres.

                            This is an image manipulation algorithm I used to distort the images for Only Shadows. I
                            needed
                            to
                            do it on the backend using node because my browser kept crashing because the images were
                            so
                            huge.

                            I had the idea to make a collaborative art app weeks earlier, but was instructed that I
                            might
                            want
                            to hold off on the idea until the later weeks in the course. When the time came around
                            for
                            our
                            class to group up and build something as a team, I was lucky enough to have two people
                            interested in making this with me.

                            A collaborative story-telling app, and also the first project I got to write from start
                            to
                            finish

                            It was during the making of this app that I learned how important it is to get normal
                            people
                            to
                            test your website during development (as opposed to other developers). I had knocked out
                            the
                            MVP
                            early in project week, and used nGrok to have my friends make a story together.

                            It was heart-warming to have the people I love use something I made together, and I got
                            important
                            feedback that I used to direct the next features I would work on.

                            My first project at G.A. Tic-Tac-Toe. I opted to skip a lot of the visual stuff this
                            time
                            around
                            and go straight for attempting an unbeatable A.I opponent. I failed at implementing the
                            minimax
                            algorithm, but it was also the first taste I got of really loving programming and seeing
                            it
                            as
                            an art rather than just a means to an end.
