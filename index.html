                <p>
                    I'm a Junior Software Developer keen to hit the ground running and kick-off my career with a bang! I
                    thrive in the intersections of technology, creativity, and community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love participating in community events either by speaking at them, helping organise them, or just
                    enjoying the talks and free pizza.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not writing code or hanging out with fellow nerds I'm usually tinkering with something
                    artsy like teaching myself how to sew, play guitar, or ceramics.
                </p>

                        Walking to the station from the state library I saw a couple of neon signs and thought it would
                        be a fun experiment to try to recreate them using CSS.

                        My final project and the hardest thing I've ever done. I took the advice of my
                        instructor at G.A and took on a passion project with a huge scope knowing it will never be quite
                        finished.

                        Combining my history as a photographer, interest in generative art and storytelling, Only
                        Shadows is a point and click adventure game based on a short story a friend of mine wrote. It's
                        made using bubble images mapped onto the inside of three.js spheres.

                        This is an image manipulation algorithm I used to distort the images for Only Shadows. I needed
                        to
                        do it on the backend using node as my browser kept crashing because the images were so large.

                        I had the idea to make a collaborative art app weeks earlier, but was instructed that I should
                        wait until the next project week when we've covered more of the relevant topics in class. When
                        the time came around for our class to group up and build something as a team, I was lucky enough
                        to have two people interested in making this with me.

                        A collaborative story-telling app, and also the first project I got to code from start
                        to finish and come up with the concept for.

                    <p>
                        It was during the making of this app that I learned how important it is to get normal
                        people to test your website during development (as opposed to other developers). I had knocked
                        out the MVP early in project week, and used nGrok to have my friends make a story together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was heart-warming to have the people I love use something I made, and I got
                        important feedback that I used to direct the next features I would work on.

                        My first project at G.A. Tic-Tac-Toe. I opted to skip a lot of the visual stuff this time around
                        and go straight for attempting an unbeatable A.I opponent. I failed at implementing the minimax
                        algorithm, but it was also the first taste I got of really loving programming and seeing it as
                        an art rather than just a means to an end.
